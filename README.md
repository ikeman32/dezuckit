Why did you make this? 
- Originally this tool was called Fzuck short of F*Zuckenberg and all it did was phonetically spell every character you could type. including newlines, punctuation marks, and spaces. 
- I was and still am angry with FB and their censorship algorithms. Not because I didn't want unfettered freedom of speech, but because these algorithms often got it wrong and can not determine context. - Also, I believe that they gave their algorithms too much power. And I was not about to accept discipline from a computer algorthim. Only a human making that decision is acceptable in my opinion. Algorithms are useful and should flag questionable content and recommend a course of action, but allow a human to make the decision. 
- I observed that FB's algorithms were not able to process misspellings and other nonsensical text so I created Fzuck as a proof of concept. 
- After two years of testing out the first interation of this tool, I found that I was right about the algorithms. - Since the first interation was never meant to a secure encyption, I decided to make this tool a more secure encyption tool. Thus dezuckit was born.
